# SimpleNotes

Web3 Notes Application built on Hedera Hashgraph.

---

## Overview

SimpleNotes is a decentralized notes application that leverages blockchain technology for secure authentication and account management.

The application removes reliance on centralized authentication servers and gives users ownership of their blockchain identity through Hedera-based account creation and wallet connection.

```env
VITE_OPERATOR_ID=your_operator_id
VITE_OPERATOR_KEY=your_private_key
VITE_NETWORK=testnet
```

Important: Never commit real private keys to version control.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
